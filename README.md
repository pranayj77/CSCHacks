# Spotify Playlist Creation & K-Means Clustering

## Project Description

Our project is centered around a clustering algorithm for songs belonging to a users
  playlists, wether it be 1 or 10. We will then output the recommended playlists per
  our clustering algorithm. We are currently thinking of implementing a K-Means clustering
  algorithm that allows the user to choose the number of playlists they want.

The challenges we anticipate in developing a properly functioning model are:

  1. User authorization to interact with the Spotify Web API
  2. Data extraction, both in gathering the data and choosing what data to use, hence point 3.
  3. Feature extraction and engineering
  4. Connecting a React-based frontend to a Flask API

The skills we will need to learn are:

  1. Exploratory Data Analysis using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib
  2. Feature Extraction to improve accuracy and reduce training time
  3. Model building
  4. Key Performance Indicators to measure our progress
  5. Full stack web development
