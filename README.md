# CSC Hacks Sample Project Repo

## Project Description

Our project is centered around a clustering algorithm for songs that feeds the user recommendations for what to listen using previous likes and listening times as a starting point. The approach we currently think of using is a K-Means clustering algorithm that will let the user choose the number of centroids to use.
