# CSC Hacks Sample Project Repo

## Project Description

Our project is centered around a clustering algorithm for songs that takes in songs users liked on Spotify and listening times and outputs a set of recommended playlists. The approach we are currently thinking of using is a K-Means clustering algorithm that will allow the user to choose the number of playlists they want.
