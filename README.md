# CSC Hacks Sample Project Repo

## Project Description

Our project is centered around a clustering algorithm for songs that takes in songs users liked on Spotify and listening times and outputs a set of recommended playlists. The approach we are currently thinking of using is a K-Means clustering algorithm that will allow the user to choose the number of playlists they want.

The challenges we anticipate in developing a properly functioning model are:

  1. Data collection -> collecting a varied and representative dataset
  2. Train our model using different "personalities" as to not overfit to particular audiences

The skills we will need to learn are:

  1. Exploratory Data Analysis using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib
  2. Feature Extraction to improve accuracy and reduce training time
  3. Model building
  4. Key Performance Indicators to measure our progress
